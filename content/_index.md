Hi there! My name is Josh and I am currently working as a quant developer in London. This mainly involves building stochastic models and other quant functionality for clients. At night, I am often working on other personal projects like home automation, self-hosted home servers, trading bots and addressable LEDs. I am passionate about all things tech and finance!
