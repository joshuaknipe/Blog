Hi there! I am currently working as a quant developer for Deloitte London. By day, I build stochastic models and other quant functionality for clients. By night, I am often working on other personal projects like home automation, self-hosted home servers, trading bots and addressable LEDs. I am passionate about all things tech and finance!
