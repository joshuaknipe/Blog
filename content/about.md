## A brief bio

Welcome! My name is Josh, and I grew up in Cape Town, South Africa. I am currently based in London, working as a quantitative developer. My professional experience has primarily focused on research and development in derivative pricing, financial modeling, and data pipelines, with smaller projects around LLMs and web development. Fortunately, my work in consulting has allowed me to tackle interesting problems for a variety of clients.

I am happiest when learning something new or solving engaging problems. This blog aims to showcase some of these learnings and projects.

### Some of my other interests include:

- **Web development**: I primarily use TailWind, React, and Next.js to build web apps for myself and friends.
- **Mobile app development**: React Native and Expo are my go-to tools for building mobile apps at the moment.
- **Generative AI**: I‚Äôm especially interested in its applications to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Check out [Rag Demo](https://github.com/joshuaknipe/RAG-app) if you're curious.
- **Personal knowledge management**: I'm a big fan of tools like Obsidian - see [this post](https://joshuaknipe.com/posts/obsidian-as-a-second-brain/) for why.
- **Self-hosting**: I run a lightweight Debian server at home for crucial services and a beefier Arch minipc for everything else. Some of my favourite services to include:
  - **Home automation**: I use [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to monitor and control my apartment.
  - **PiHole**: I use [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block ads and track my home network's activity. Initially, IPv6 caused some issues, but flashing [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) onto my router and setting up DHCP reservations fixed them.
  - **Youtube summarizer**: I built a custom [Youtube video summarizer](https://github.com/joshuaknipe/ytsummarizer) to condense videos.
  - **Hyperion**: I use [Hyperion](https://hyperion-project.org/) to sync addressable RGB LEDs to my TV. See [this demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/Ao_SEIQEyLU?si=yeyIdVStw6NVg6z1) for my setup.
  - **Code-server**: I use [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) to access my Linux server and run code editor sessions remotely.
  - **Media server**: I use [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/) to stream my media to all my devices, which has helped me cut the YouTube app from my phone‚Äîa big boost to my productivity.
  - **VPN**: I use a wireguard based VPN [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) to connect all my devices when I'm away from home.
- **Classic literature**: I especially enjoy works by Dostoyevsky, Steinbeck, and Kundera.
