Welcome! My name is Josh, and I grew up in Cape Town, South Africa. I am currently based in London, working as a quantitative developer. My professional experience has primarily focused on research and development in derivative pricing, financial modeling, and data pipelines, with smaller projects around LLMs and web development. Fortunately, my work in consulting has allowed me to tackle interesting problems for a variety of clients!

I am happiest when learning something new or solving engaging problems. This blog aims to showcase some of these learnings and projects.

### Some of my other interests include:

- **Web development**: I primarily use TailWind, React, and Next.js to build web apps. This blog is built with Hugo though - I wanted a fast framework that offered me flexibility in design and deployment. See [this post](/blog/building-this-website/) for more.
- **Mobile app development**: React Native and Expo are my go-to tools for building mobile apps currently.
- **Generative AI**: I‚Äôm especially interested in its applications to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Check out [Rag Demo](https://github.com/joshuaknipe/RAG-app) if you're curious.
- **Personal knowledge management**: I'm a big fan of tools like Obsidian - see [this post](/blog/obsidian-as-a-second-brain/) for why.
- **Self-hosting**: I run a lightweight Debian server at home for crucial services and a beefier Arch minipc for everything else. Some of my favourite services to include:
  - **Hyperion**: I use Hyperion to sync addressable RGB LEDs to my TV. See [this demo](https://youtube.com/shorts/Ao_SEIQEyLU?si=yeyIdVStw6NVg6z1) for my home setup.
  - **Youtube summarizer**: I built a custom [Youtube video summarizer](https://github.com/joshuaknipe/ytsummarizer) with Flask to condense videos.
  - **Home automation**: I use Home Assistant to monitor and control my apartment.
  - **PiHole**: I use PiHole to block ads and track my home network's activity. Initially, IPv6 caused some issues, but flashing OpenWrt onto my router and setting up DHCP reservations fixed them.
- **Classic literature**: I especially enjoy works by Dostoyevsky, Steinbeck, and Kundera.
