# About me

## A brief bio

Welcome! My name is Josh Knipe and I grew up in Cape Town, South Africa. I moved to London in 2023 and am currently working here as a quantitative developer.

I love to build things - both in software and in the real world. Some of my interests include:

- **Web development**: I am currently using mostly TailWind, React and Next.js to build web apps for myself and friends
- **Mobile app development**: React Native and Expo is my go-to for building mobile apps at the moment
- **Generative AI**: especially its applications to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). See [Rag Demo](https://github.com/joshuaknipe/RAG-app) if you're interested
- **Personal knowledge management**: I'm a big fan of tools like Obsidian and [this](https://joshuaknipe.com/posts/obsidian-as-a-second-brain/) is why
- **Self-hosting**: I run a lightweight Debian server at home for all my crucial services and a beefier Arch minipc for everything else. Some of my favourite services to run include:
  - **Home automation**: I use [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to monitor and control my apartment
  - **PiHole**: I use [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block ads and track my home network's activity. IPv6 caused me some issues initially, but flashing [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) onto my router and setting up DHCP reservations fixed them
  - **Youtube summarizer**: I use a custom built [Youtube video summarizer](https://github.com/joshuaknipe/ytsummarizer) to summarise youtube videos
  - **Hyperion**: I use [Hyperion](https://hyperion-project.org/) to sync addressable RGB LEDs to my TV. See [this](https://youtube.com/shorts/Ao_SEIQEyLU?si=yeyIdVStw6NVg6z1) for a demo of my setup
  - **Code-server**: I use [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) to access my Linux server and run code editor sessions remotely
  - **Media server**: I use [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/) to stream my media to all my devices. This has helped me cut the Youtube app from my phone - a big boost to my productivity
  - **VPN**: I use a wireguard based VPN [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) to connect all my devices when I'm away from home
- **Classic literature**: especially anything by Dostoyevsky, Steinbeck or Kundera
