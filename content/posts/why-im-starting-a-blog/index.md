For a long time, I've wanted an outlet to consolidate and share knowledge I've gained from studying topics that fascinate me. We're living in an era of overwhelming information flow, and it's all too easy to read or learn something valuable one day, only to forget it soon after. By starting this blog, I aim to create a repository for capturing key learnings, reflections and ideas in a more permanent (and organized) way.


## Path to deeper understanding
One of my main motivations is to use writing as a tool for *deeper* understanding. The process of breaking down complex concepts and articulating them in my own words forces me to really grapple with and internalize the material. Writing is thinking, and maintaining a blog will serve as an intellectual exercise to clarify my thoughts. 

Another benefit of this approach is the iterative learning process it fosters. By regularly revisiting and writing about topics I've previously explored, I can deepen my understanding and uncover new layers of complexity that I might have missed during my initial studies. This continuous refinement and iteration will not only solidify my grasp of the material but also ensure that my knowledge stays current and evolves. Ultimately, this method of learning reinforces a growth mindset, constantly pushing me to ask new questions and seek more nuanced answers.

## Going public more often
There is value in making a habit of routinely creating content and shipping work into the public realm, regardless of how polished or profound it is. Too often we hold back our voices and perspectives out of fear they aren't good enough or a desire to accomplish something "great" before sharing it. I aim to overcome those mental hurdles by committing to regularly publishing posts, no matter how small.

This blog will also function as a personal milestone marker, documenting my thoughts and perspectives at different points in time. In the future, I'll be able to look back on old posts and reflect on how my thinking and opinions have evolved over the years. Capturing my intellectual journey in writing will be a insightful exercise.

## Community and collaboration
I'm also hoping to build a community around this blog. I'm not sure how I'll do this, but I'm hoping to find a way to connect with people who share similar interests and passions. I'm also hoping to find a way to share my ideas and learnings with others.

So in short - this blog will be my own little corner of the internet for documenting a perpetual journey of learning, refining ideas through writing, tracking my intellectual growth, building practical skills, and hopefully connecting with kindred minds along the way. Thanks for joining me on that journey by reading this inaugural post. Let's get started!
